# reactFrontendChallenge
A simple react coding challenge done with a time constraint of 3 hours. ( Focus here was not visuals but rather some frontend functionality, just some time spent after the features were done to make it look ok. )

The webapp should be a single page application using the [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) to get an overwiew of a TV-series and have it's first season episodes displayed in a list.

Some features required to be done was:

* The ability to change the TV-series displayed.

* Function to hide/remove single episodes from the displayed list.

* Get the average IMDB rating for each episode, and visually change an episode if it has a higher rating than 8,5.
